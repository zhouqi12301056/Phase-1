    Nowadays, more and more people own smart phones and they are eager to take photos.What's more, some photos that they took are of 
high quality and can do earn money by selling them. However, there is not a existing platform for common users to sell their 
original photos. Besides, when the application is first bulit, we would nest some professional photographers, the photographers 
can hold an auction. We will get a cut if users sell their photos via our application and we will donate the money that we got to
charity fundations. 
    The target users are people who have a smart phone, like taking photos and are willing to help  others.
